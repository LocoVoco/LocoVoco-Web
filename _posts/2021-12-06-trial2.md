### The goal of the trial run

Back in July of this year, we had our prototype trial run of LocoVoco, after the run finished I had lots of life-changing decisions to make and things to get in place. I had to decide on whether to quit my corporate job, then quit the job all the while working evenings/weekends trying to get to the next stage of the LocoVoco startup journey.

Once I’d taken the plunge to work on LocoVoco full time I decided after my notice period was up we should get a trial run going so we could hit the road running with this new venture, the goals for this trial were:

* Get some more users and feedback.
* Get a much improved version of LocoVoco out.

This release wasn't going to prove whether LocoVoco will be a global success, (I believe it will be 🙏) as we need far more data and users before we can show that is the case. 

**Result of our second trial: Success! The release met the goal of getting a much-improved version of LocoVoco out and attracting new users 💃**

### Highlights of the release

#### The Good

* We had another successful release and technically the app worked flawlessly.
* We had an increase in users from our pilot release.

#### The Bad

The release was still missing chat, this meant that for some users it was a hassle rearranging a meetup.

#### The Ugly

One user had a no show and it was our fault 😬. They traveled on the bus for 45 minutes to the West End and ended up not meeting anyone. Unfortunately, the other party in the meetup had in fact tried to get our help to contact the user in advance of the meetup to cancel it, but we didn't see their email in time, and couldn’t inform the user.

We felt bad that someone who was good enough to trial our app at this early stage had their time wasted. We sent out a £10 voucher for a local cafe as an apology, fortunately they accepted this and were really understanding about our mistake.

In our next release, this scenario can't happen as users will be able to communicate via chat in the app.

#### How many people trialled the app

From 154 users down to 31 is a pretty big drop, so we need to improve our communication to everyone to show that our app is simple to use and is a great way to meet new people. Hopefully in the next release more of our 154 signed-up users will install and try out LocoVoco.

### Major changes in this release:

* **Login with Apple:**

For the initial release we emailed each user a username and password, we needed to change this to make the login process as smooth as possible. Fortunately, on ios we can use [sign in with apple](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210318). This requires no username and password, is completely secure, and offers such features as the user being able to hide their real email address.

* **The list of invites screen has been changed to a carousel:**

This change was the most significant update in the release. In our initial pilot, we simply displayed a list of invites, users had to click on an item to view the details of the invite. This was a poor UI but it was good enough for the initial pilot. We've now updated the interface to display a carousel of invites that users can swipe back and forward through.

### Next Steps

**Next release of LocoVoco early February! 🚀**

It's still early days in the LocoVoco startup journey, for the next release we are hoping to include the following new features:

* We will be adding cafes from the East End of Glasgow for users to meet up at.
* The app will have a much improved, simplified interface and be far more visually engaging.
* We will have chat 🎉! This is a much-requested feature that will make it far easier for users to arrange meetups.

We will be posting more details about our upcoming release on Facebook and Twitter, would be great if you can be part of our next release 🙏.
