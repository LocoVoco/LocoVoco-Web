### What we were looking for from the trial run.

Our first prototype trial run of LocoVoco was back in July this year, after the run completed I had lot's of life changing decision to make and things to get in place. I had to make the decision on whether to quit my corporate job, I had to then continue on with the job while working evening weekends trying to get to the next stage of the LocoVoco startup journey during all of this I also create a new company along with all of what that entails.

Once I'd taken the plunge to do this full time I decided that as soon as my 3 months notice at my old job where up I had to get a trial run going in order that I could hit the road running with this new venture, the goals for this release where:

- Get a much improved version of LocoVoco out and get users to use it.
- Get some more users and get some more feedback.

This release was never going to show whether LocoVoco was going to be a global success, I believe it will be üôè, but we need far more data and users before we can show that is the case.

### Major changes in this release:

The following are the major changes in this release:

* Login with apple:

For the initial release we emailed each user a username and password, we needed to change this to make the login as smooth as possible, fortunately on ios we can use [sign in with apple](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210318). This requires no username and password is completely secure and offers such features to the user of hiding their real email address.

* Users now had the option to pass or accept someone who accepted the invite

### Highlights of the release


#### The Good

We had more users than the initial trial run.
The app had some core additional feature

#### The Bad

The users who didn

#### The Ugly

A user travelled on the bus for 45 minutes to the West End and ended up not meeting someone, this was our fault not the know show

I felt incredibly bad that someone who was good enough to trial our app at this early stage had had their time wasted, we've sent them a ¬£10 gift voucher and


### How many users did we get.

### Next Steps

It's still very early days in the LocoVoco startup journey, for the next release we are hoping for:

- We need to get feedback from everyone
- The app will have a much improved simplified interface
- We will have chat üéâ, this is a much requested feature that will make it far easier for users to arrange meetups.
- We're going to engage much more with our users via social media

- User Feedback, mention that we want to get feedback to basically improve the app, at this stage

We are teaming up with Absolute Roasters to offer ¬£5 vouchers

### Looking for user feedback

We need user feedback to know how to make this better for the next trial run, specific feedback we are looking for is:

If you signed up for the trial run but didn't install it, what was the reason.
If you installed the app but didn't accept any invites for the app what was the reason.

For everyone who installed the app we are incredibly grateful for trialling the app at its early stage, we are offering a ¬£5 off at one of the cafes that was involved in our trial
