### What we were looking for from the trial run.

Our prototype trial run of LocoVoco was back in July this year after the run was completed I had lots of life-changing decisions to make and things to get in place. I had to decide on whether to quit my corporate job, I then quit the job all the while working evenings/weekends trying to get to the next stage of the LocoVoco startup journey.

Once I’d taken the plunge to do this full time I decided as soon as my 3 months notice was up I had to get a trial run going so that I could hit the road running with this new venture, the goals for this release were:

* Get some more users and get some more feedback.
* Get a much improved version of LocoVoco out and get users to use it.

This release was never going to show whether LocoVoco was going to be a global success, I believe it will be 🙏, but we need far more data and users before we can show that is the case. 

**Success, the releases met the goal of getting a much-improved version of LocoVoco out and getting some more users 💃**

### Major changes in this release:

* **Login with apple:**

For the initial release we emailed each user a username and password, we needed to change this to make the login process as smooth as possible, fortunately, on ios we can use [sign in with apple](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210318). This requires no username and password, is completely secure, and offers such features to the user of hiding their real email address.

* **Users have the option to pass or confirm an accepted invite:**

  </div>

Previously if someone accepted your inite, that was it you had no option to decide whether to accept the acceptor or whether to wait to see who else wants to accept your invite. In this release we changed this so that you can pass and wait to see who else will accept your invite

* **The invites listing has been changed from a list to a carousel:**

This change was the most significant change in the release. In our initial pilot release, we simply had a list of invites, and users had to click on an item to view the details of the invite, this was a poor UI but it was just an initial pilot. We've now updated the interface to have a carousel of invites that users can swipe back and forward through.

### Highlights of the release

#### The Good

* We had another successful release, where technically the app worked pretty flawlessly
* We had some more users using the app than the first release.

#### The Bad

The release was still missing chat, this meant that for some users it was a hassle rearranging when they could meet up with someone.

#### The Ugly

A user had a no show and it was our fault 😬. They traveled on the bus for 45 minutes to the West End and ended up not meeting someone, the other user had mailed us that they wouldn't make the meetup but we hadn't read the mail in time so couldn't inform the partner in the meet-up.

We felt really bad that someone who was good enough to trial our app at this early stage and had their time wasted, We sent out a £10 voucher for a local cafe as an apology, fortunately, the user was great about everything.

In our next release, this scenario won't happen as users will be able to communicate via chat in the app.

#### How many users did we get.

From 154 users down to 31 is a pretty big drop, we need to improve our communication to everyone to show that our app is simple to use and is a great way to meet new people. Hopefully in the next release more of our 154 signed-up users will install and try out LocoVoco.

### Next Steps

**Next release of LocoVoco early February! 🚀**

It's still early days in the LocoVoco startup journey, for the next release we are hoping to include:

* We need to get as much feedback as possible from everyone who used the app.
* We will be including the East End of Glasgow cafes.
* The app is going to be on the app store, this will mean our users don't have the additional step.
* The app will have a much improved simplified interface and be far more visually engaging.
* We will have chat 🎉, this is a much-requested feature that will make it far easier for users to arrange meetups.

We will be posting more details about our upcoming release on Facebook and Twitter, would be great if you can be part of our next release 🙏.

### Looking for user feedback

We need user feedback to know how to make this better for the next trial run, specific feedback we are looking for is:

If you signed up for the trial run but didn't install it, what was the reason?
If you installed the app but didn't accept any invites or send out any invites what was the reason?

If anyone has any comments about content in this blog or any ideas feedback about the release please add a comment in the comments section at the bottom of this blog.

### Thanks to everyone who took part

For everyone who installed the app, we are incredibly grateful for trialing the app at its early stage, as a token of our appreciation, we're offering a £5 off voucher 🎁  at one of the cafes that was involved in our trial.

Finally, I'd just like to say thanks to everyone who was part of this trial run, we massively appreciate it!.
