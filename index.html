                        <p>
                            We are a new company who want to help people meetup and get connected in the physical
                            world
                            and
                            out of the
                            virtual world. <br />
                            We believe that connecting makes for happier people and a happier world.
                            Watch this space as we work on technology to help bring people together.<br />
                        <h4 style="color: #19C4A3;">Let's cure the disconnect.</h4>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <br />

                    <div class="center">

                        <h2>The App</h2>

                        <p>
                            We are developing an app in Glasgow which will allow users to meet like-minded people
                            and
                            have a
                            chat, have a coffee, see if they connect. <br />
                            It's a simple idea: instead of chatting online all day, swiping left or right and
                            scrolling
                            through pixelated people,
                            we think that if someone looks like your type of person you should get out there and
                            meet
                            them.
                            The idea isn't for dating or hookups - there are already plenty of apps for this. Our
                            app is
                            designed for you to make new aquaintances, make new friends and meet new people
                            in your area to form better communities. Why waste all day chatting via apps to see if
                            you
                            will
                            connect with someone? Meeting up in person in the real world
                            surely is a much more enjoyable experience.
