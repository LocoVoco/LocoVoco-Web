                    <p>
                        We are a new company who wants to help people meetup get connected in the physical world and out
                        of
                        the
                        virtual world. <br />
                        Watch this space as we look into using technology to help people get together, as we believe
                        more
                        people
                        connecting together makes happier people and hopefully a happier world. <br />

                    <h2>The App</h2>

                    <p>
                        We are currently developing an App in Glasgow that allows users to meet like minded people for a
                        coffee
                        to have a chat see if they connect leading to meeting new people.
                        It's a simple idea meet people in your local area for a coffee, don't chat to them on line all
                        day,
                        don't swipe left right to reject/accept people all day instead our view is if someone looks to
                        be
                        your
                        type of person
                        Then get out there and meet them for a coffee and see if you connect, why waste all day chatting
                        via
                        apps to see if you will connect with a new friend, meeting up with a person in the real world
                        surely
                        is
                        a much more pleasant experience.
                        Who doesn't like meeting new people in this cafe obsessed world
                    </p>
