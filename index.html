                    <p>
                        We are a new company who want to help people meetup and get connected in the physical world and out of the
                        virtual world. <br />
                        We believe that connecting makes for happier people and a happier world. 
                        Watch this space as we work on technology to help bring people together.<br />

                    <h2>The App</h2>

                    <p>
                        We are developing an app in Glasgow which will allow users to meet like-minded people and have a chat, have a coffee, see if they connect. <br />
                        It's a simple idea: instead of chatting online all day, swiping left or right and scrolling through pixelated people, 
                        we think that if someone looks like your type of person you should get out there and meet them. The idea isn't for dating or hookups there are already plenty of apps for this, our app is designed for you to make new aquaintances, make new friends and meet new people 
                        in your area to form better communities. Why waste all day chatting via apps to see if you will connect with someone, meeting up in person in the real world
                        surely is a much more enjoyable experience.
                    </p>
